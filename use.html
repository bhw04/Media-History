<p>Opposing <span id="red">the innovation-centric approach</span> where there are <span id="jj">no failures, no alternatives, a little bit of progress means that we reached modernity, there isn’t a messy timeline, a linear one is there where all technologies are sequential, and where scientists and inventors are “ahead of their time”.</span>

<p>History <span id="pp">SHOULDN’T</span> be viewed from the innovation-centric approach because it doesn’t give people an opportunity to learn the real meaning and exactly what happened in history of media which led us to today’s accomplishments.</p>

   <p> The way we communicate with each other becomes different; all our communication skills are from technology, e.g. when I talk to someone face-to-face I don’t plan my conversation ahead of time, it comes naturally. However, using nowadays’ technologies have reshaped our way of communication.</p>
                                   
                                  <h2>Who has the agency? Users or the media?</h2>
<dl>In the history of media technology we have:
	<dt>Technological determinism</dt>
<dd> where it suggests that technology itself causes change, often in ways that people don’t intend and are unaware of, where the more emphasis is on the role of technology. </dd>
	<dt>Social constructionism</dt>
<dd> where it emphasizes that technology is made up of inanimate objects and ultimately people decide how to use or not use technology, where the more emphasis is on human agency.</dd>
<dt>	Social shaping</dt>
<dd> where it emphasizes that both technology and human agency are balanced and on the same track. 
What we want you to know is that the media doesn’t have the full control on us at all, we can give feedback on the content aired and we have the power to interpret the media messages through our own social lens; we’re active readers of the media content and not just passive receivers. </dd>
</dl>


     <p>Take for example, a very well know person who likes to dig deep into the history of technologies, how they were made, and what challenges inventors faced to reach inventing it. 


!!!!!Like we said before, when watching or reading about media history authors are going to make it seem as if these technologies are like air; where you couldn’t survive without them before they were made!!!!!!</p>
       
   <p>Of course, when learning about media you should always analyze the way the author is writing or describing the process of these inventions which is really important to see whether he’s talking and using the use-based approach or the innovation-centric one.</p>
  <p>Imagine you and your friends are watching a 30 minute video about history of media, where a diverse amount of technologies are shown, explaining how inventors thought, collected, and decided on the innovation. The first idea that should pop into your head is the, drumroll please, yesss!!!! <span id="no">The USE-BASED MODEL.</span></p>
  
  <h2 id="u"> ATTENTION!!!</h2>
  <ul>
  <li> Don't compare old to new </li>
  <li> Appreciate the small inventions and not only the big ones </li>
  <li> Focus on how things are used and not what they do</li>
  <li> The newest doesn't need to be better than the old to be widely used</li>
  <li> There might be many alternatives, but the use of the latest would be<span id="hh"> marginally</span> better</li>
  </ul>
   
 
<p>In conclusion, the major points that you are going to be taking with you to class, after reading this guidebook, is your view on media history which is definitely supposed to change where you view media history from a different angle, using the use-based approach.</p>
