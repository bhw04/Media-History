<h2 id="lo"> What do people think about media history?</h2>

<h2>Let's ask you couple of questions</h2> 
<ol>
<li>How do you view media history?</li>
<li> In what way are you going to look at it?</li>
<li> What are the dos and don'ts of studying media history?</li>
<li> Is it going to be boring?</li>
</ol>
<br>

<p> All these questions are going to be answered in a very clear way in this guidebook. Of course when a person thinks about the history of anything he/she gets drained or feels the urge to sleep because they are going to be gazing at dates and names of people they have never heard of, however media history is different. It doesn’t include learning any of those, <span id="yes">but learning how to approach all the inventions in order to learn it the proper way.</span></p>

   <p>The first idea that you’re going to learn about in this guidebook is <span id="yes">the way you’re going to approach this history.</span> This approach is new, yet, so simple; <span id="no">The Use-Based approach</span>. It’s going to be the <span id="hh">microscope</span> that you’re going to explore media with.</p> 
  <p> Don’t complicate things on yourself, it’s as simple as the combined words; the use of the media and how it affects the surroundings and what is it based on:</p>
<ul>  
  <li> Messy timeline</li>
  <li> Alternatives</li>
  <li> Mix and Match</li>
  <li> Failures are present</li>
  </ul>    
 
<p>Today the internet is a second away from you, whatever you want to find or learn about is directly there. However, before all of the inventions, people weren’t able to communicate at all, until they found a way to send messages by a horse or flying bird, these are the known ones. When the message was sent it took months to reach the recipient. That is why it is important for a person to have background knowledge about how media came together and how it reached such advancements and success.</p> 

        <p><span id="hh">The use-based approach</span> is where there was a Global history in which several technologies appear. Also, these technologies aren’t consecutive. Which means that the inventions weren’t produced in a certain sequence, which is very important for you to know because the history of media had a <span id="no">very messy timeline</span>.</p>
   <p>Consequently, first thing that should be in your minds is <span id="no">alternatives</span>. They were not only present, but also widely used instead of more successful technologies. Alternatives back then were so important because not all people afforded successful inventions in which they could use. Moreover, inventions used to <span id="no">appear at times and disappear</span> at others. Which can also make you understand how inventions weren’t based on a specific type of era. </p>
    <p><span id="no">Failures</span> occurred, and it’s not necessarily a bad effect because due to failures inventors were only a step closer to producing the best version.</p>
 <p>History of media contained many known people who invented famous inventions which you probably heard off, such as the printing press or the telegraph. These inventions were the start of the future and its succession.</p>
